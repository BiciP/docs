### Pre-Activation Checklist

First verify all datasources (PDFs, websites, text) are properly uploaded and processed, especially checking OCR accuracy for scanned documents. Thoroughly test the agent in Playground with sample questions across different categories, including edge cases. Confirm responses match your desired tone, length, and accuracy standards. Validate that unanswered questions trigger appropriate fallback messages. Only enable the agent after it reliably handles these test cases in the Playground environment.
